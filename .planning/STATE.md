# MLPerf Storage v3.0 - Project State

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Orchestrate multiple benchmark types (training, checkpointing, kv-cache, vectordb) across distributed systems and produce verified, rules-compliant results.

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 - Package Management Foundation

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 of 10 - Package Management Foundation
**Plan:** Not started
**Status:** Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 10 phases for comprehensive depth | Requirements naturally cluster into 10 delivery boundaries given dependencies | 2026-01-23 |
| Package management first | Foundation for reproducibility, enables fail-fast validation | 2026-01-23 |
| UX validation before benchmarks | Fail-fast pattern reduces wasted time on misconfigured environments | 2026-01-23 |
| KV/VDB benchmarks parallel tracks | Both can develop after fail-fast validation, no interdependency | 2026-01-23 |
| Progress indication last | Applies broadly, benefits from all other work being done | 2026-01-23 |

### Technical Patterns Established

- Benchmark base class pattern: Subclass, set BENCHMARK_TYPE, implement _run()
- Registry pattern for CLI construction
- MPI-based cluster collection existing, SSH to be added
- DLIO as underlying engine for training/checkpointing

### Open TODOs

- [ ] Plan Phase 1 with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
- [ ] Review external KV cache code in `kv_cache_benchmark/`
- [ ] Review VectorDB scripts from external branch
- [ ] Verify DLIO parquet support requirements

### Active Blockers

None currently.

### Notes

- 6-week feature freeze timeline
- Existing KVCacheBenchmark class exists but needs full integration
- VectorDBBenchmark class exists as stub, needs implementation
- MPI collection works, SSH collection needs to be added

## Session Continuity

### Last Session
- **Date:** 2026-01-23
- **Accomplished:** Created roadmap with 10 phases, initialized state
- **Next:** Plan Phase 1 (Package Management Foundation)

### Context for Next Session
- Roadmap approved and written to .planning/ROADMAP.md
- 21 v1 requirements mapped across 10 phases
- Phase dependencies documented in roadmap
- Ready to begin Phase 1 planning
